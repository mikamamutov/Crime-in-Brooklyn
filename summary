I got the data from BetaNYC on crime in NYC through APIs. 
It has weekly numbers for each precinct in NYC. For example, “Petit Larceny” week 7/24/2024 - 7/30/2024 34.
I cleaned up the dates for some of the weeks.
Then I zoom in into South and North Brooklyn and merge data into a data frame.

First, I want to see if there is more crime in Summer than in Winter months in Brooklyn in 2023.

Generally, it was true there was more crime in Summer than in Winter in 2023 except Rape and Murder. 
I then checked if it's true for 2022. It was not. Some crimes happened more frequently in Summer, others in Winter. 
Summer vs Winter 2022 crimes were inconsistent with Summer vs Winter 2023.

Second, I decided to look into 4 types of what I called “theft”: Petit Larceny, Grand Larceny, Burglary, and Robbery. 
Petit Larceny is the most frequent of these four in Brooklyn in 2022-2024 which makes sense because it's the least risky.
I was surprised that Burglary and Robbery happened almost at the same rate. 
Robbery is much riskier, has a bigger punishment, and involves interaction with a victim and a “threat of violence”. 
Anything can happen. Burglary is less risky, does not require interaction with a victim, and has a smaller punishment than robbery. 
Surprisingly, robbery and burglary happened almost at the same rate. Sometimes, burglary happens less often.

Third, I created an interactive dashboard using Dash that allows a user to pick a type of crime and between 2022 and early 2024.

I found out that NYC police has a website that shows all this data in an interactive dashboard 
with more detailed data than mine except there is no filter for dates, only the most recent week.
